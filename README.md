# leaflet-challenge
This project utilizes Leaflet.js and D3.js to create an interactive map that visualizes real-time earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The map displays earthquakes based on their magnitude and depth, with color-coded markers that provide an intuitive understanding of seismic activity. Users can interact with the map to explore details about each earthquake, including location, magnitude, and depth. Additionally, an optional layer displays tectonic plate boundaries, highlighting their correlation with earthquake occurrences. This project enhances the accessibility of geological data, aiding public awareness and research efforts.
